Code:

v1=int(input ("Enter the first number:"))
v2=int(input ("Enter the second number:"))
Sum=v1+v2
Diff=v1-v2
Product=v1*v2
Division=v1/v2
print("Addition of two no.s :",Sum)
print("Subtraction of two no.s:",Diff)
print("Multiplication of two no s:", Product)
print("Division of two no.s:",Division)

Output:

Enter the first number:50
Enter the second number:20
Addition of two no.s : 70
Subtraction of two no.s: 30
Multiplication of two no s: 1000
Division of two no.s: 2.5
